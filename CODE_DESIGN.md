# Code Design

This file contains notes about code design and conventions with the aim of
making collaboration and future modifications easier.

## Naming
- Snake case is used wherever possible
- Test files are named `test-XX_DESCRIPTION.R`, where `XX` is the order they 
  should be run (try to test lower order functions first).

## Code formating
- Put closing brackets `)` on the next line for multi-line functions

## Best practices
- Do not use `return()` unless calling high up in a function

## tidyeval
- Use {{ }} where tidyeval variable used directly
- Use `rlang::as_label(rlang::enquo())` to get name
  - For unclear reasons, the `check_column()` function calls have to be in the 
    main function and cannot be moved into a sub `check_XXX()` function

## Documentation
- Reuse common documentation with `@inheritParams common_docs` and 
  `@inheritSection common_docs SECTION NAME`.
   - see rOxygen article: https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/reuse.html#inheriting-documentation
   - see `R/aa_common_docs.R` for where the common descriptions are stored
  
## Other
- For `purrr::map()` if passing `...` must use the base R anonymous function 
  `\(x)` and *not* the lambda notation `~`. This is because the lambda notaion
  passes the mapped variable in as `...` or `.x` or `..1`, so the global `...`
  is overwritten. The R base `\(x)` passes it in as `x` only.
